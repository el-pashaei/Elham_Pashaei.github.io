<h3> Attendance policy </h3>
Please notify me in advance if you will miss any exam due to a University sanctioned excuse (medical absence,etc.).  In case of sudden illness that causes you to miss an exam you must provide me with a medical note documenting the illness, and clearly specifying the days/times that you were incapacitated due to illness. 
Part of the class grade is participation. Reasonable absences will be accommodated when grading.

<h3>Late policy </h3>
You can submit up to 2 programming assignments up to 2 days late without any penalty, after which no credit will be given.

<h3> Academic honesty </h3>
Simply cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstance. While you are allowed to prepare for assignments, you must complete all assignments by yourselves. Also, all exams are strictly individual.
In particular, the code you submit must be your own. I am well aware of the various code floating around github and other online forums.
